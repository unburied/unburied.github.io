# First Post (5/19)
Hello!? Is this thing on? Hope so. Otherwise i'd just be talking to myself, heh. Seriously. I am really nervouse about all of this. I'm hoping I made the right decision by choosing Lambda school, and choosing data science. Its daunting. There are a lot of variables; dependent, confounding variables. There is no machine learning algorithm in place to tell you if you are making the right decision. At least there isn't yet. Maybe there is a model that I can feed features and fun facts that will give me a statistical probability of success. Then I can make my decision off that, right!? No. Even if it results in being a low chance, it's not no chance. Humans take risks. Successful people take risk. Risk aversion is not what advances society. We take our chances because if we don't, we will never succeed; we will never grow. So this is my proclamation that I have made the right decision! I will attain my goals. And if anything, at least I made this cool little jekyll page..

## Credits

This template was not made entirely from scratch. I would like to give special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.
- [Iron Summit Media](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia) and their project [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog), from which I've used some design ideas and some of the templating code for posts and pagination.

I'd also like to thank [Dr. Jekyll's Themes](https://drjekyllthemes.github.io/), [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and another [Jekyll Themes](http://jekyllrc.github.io/jekyllthemes/) for featuring Beautiful Jekyll in their Jekyll theme directories.

Thank you to [all contributors](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/graphs/contributors). Special thanks to  [@OCram85](https://github.com/OCram85) for contributing multiple times as well as helping with discussions.

If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate if you keep the link in the footer to this project.  I've noticed that several people who forked this repo removed the attribution and I would prefer to get the recognition if you do use this :)

## Known limitations

- If you have a project page and you want a custom 404 page, you must have a custom domain.  See https://help.github.com/articles/custom-404-pages/.  This means that if you have a regular User Page you can use the 404 page from this theme, but if it's a website for a specific repository, the 404 page will not be used.
