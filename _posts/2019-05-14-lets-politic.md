Hello!? Is this thing on? Hope so. Otherwise i'd just be talking to myself, heh. Seriously. I am really nervouse about all of this. I'm hoping I made the right decision by choosing Lambda school, and choosing data science. Its daunting. There are a lot of variables; dependent, confounding variables. There is no machine learning algorithm in place to tell you if you are making the right decision. At least there isn't yet. Maybe there is a model that I can feed features and fun facts that will give me a statistical probability of success. Then I can make my decision off that, right!? No. Even if it results in being a low chance, it's not no chance. Humans take risks. Successful people take risk. Risk aversion is not what advances society. We take our chances because if we don't, we will never succeed; we will never grow. So this is my proclamation that I have made the right decision! I will attain my goals. And if anything, at least I made this cool little jekyll page..
