title: Detecting Anomalies that lead to Hard Drive Failure
--- 

Anomaly Detection is one of the more difficult areas of machine learning, but it is also one of the most important.
But how do you predict an event that has a probability of occurring .1% of the time. Or even .01% of the time? I  
have an opportunity to dive into a problem that offers even more difficulty, hard drive failure.
Since it is so rare for the drives to fail, anomaly detection will be our *modus operandi*.
This will allow us to offer the probability that a particular hard drive will fail.
