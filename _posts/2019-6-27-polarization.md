title: Polarization in the Politcal Spectrum!
---

Are politics becoming more polazrized? I attempt to answer this question using congressional voting data generated over the last 30 years.  This was a great project that I look forward to continue working on. I learned so many things in the last two months, including the fact that analysis can never truly be complete. It was great to put a lot of the techniques I learned to good use and develope this awesome blog post. What was even more rewarding was the exposure to project developement first hand. The setbacks, and pitfalls. The need to pivot and deliver ON TIME! I'm truly thankful.
